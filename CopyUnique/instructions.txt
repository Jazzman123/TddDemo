Program requirements:

CopyUnique should be a console application that takes as parameters two folder paths: source and destination.
The application should copy all unique files from the source folder into the destination folder, where a
unique file is defined as one whose contents are not identical to the contents of any other file in the folder.
(File names do not matter and are not used to determine uniqueness.)
